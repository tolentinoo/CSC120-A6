- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I worked with Gracia Bareti. Pair programming is really efficient and I recommend it to everyone I know taking intro. Reading the directions a few time and psuedo-coding works. Planning out my code does not work sometimes though. Inheritance can be tedious when first introduced to it. But the more I practice it the more confident I feel in using inheritance.
